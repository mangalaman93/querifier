querifier
=========

To create an interface for students to submit queries and verify the submitted queries with the desired result as per the query provided by the instructor. The crux of the problem is in determining whether or not a pair of queries will produce identical result sets for ALL the data sets and not just a partic- ular data set. This will require running the queries on a set of test data sets and comparing the results. Thus, generation of these test data sets is very important which will ensure the correctness of the queries.
